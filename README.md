5. difference between inline, block, and inline-block elements. is it possible to change an inline element into a block-level element?

```
<a> <b> <strong> <i> <em> <u> <span> <img> <br> 
<input> <label> <mark> 
<small> <sub> <sup> 
<code> <time>
```

- Block: Full width, starts on a new line (```<div>```).
```
    <div>
    <p> 
    <heading_tags> 
    <list_tags>
    <table_tags> 
    <form> 
    <section> <article> 
    <header> <footer>
```
- Inline-Block: Behaves like inline but allows setting width/height.
- Changing Inline to Block: Use ```display: block;``` in CSS.

### CSS vs CSS3
<b>CSS3</b> is an upgraded version of CSS with modular improvements, advanced selectors (before only id, class, element), responsive design (@media queries), animations (@keyframes, transition), and modern layout techniques (Flexbox, Grid). It also introduces enhanced styling features like border-radius, box-shadow, and custom fonts (@font-face). These enhancements make web design more efficient, responsive, and visually appealing while reducing reliance on images and JavaScript.

### 5 things for responsiveness
1. Break points
2. Media query
3. style changes
4. image fluid
5. relative measuring units and Testing!
