## JS
1. highly abstracted language
    - hiding the implementation details
    - showing only the functionality to the users

- don't need to do these manually:
    - resource management and memory allocation
    - garbage collection
    - then developers can focus on logic better
    - improve understandability and maintainability

2. a JIT compiled language
    - not a purely interpreted language
    - JUST-IN-TIME compiler converts the entire code into machine code execute them immediately
    - js ----> parsing --AST--> compilation (JIT) --> machine code ----> execution
    - AST: abstract syntax tree

3. a multi-paradigm language
- Paradigm: code structure that will determine the style or a way of programming
    1. procedural
    2. object-oriented
    3. functional
