/**
 * --------- keydown vs keypress vs keyup ---------
 * 
 * keydown: Fires when the key is pressed, but the letter may not appear in the input field yet.
 * keypress: Fires when a character key is pressed, but itâ€™s deprecated.
 * keyup: Fires after the key is released, when the character is already added to the input field.
 * 
 * - keypress fires on only character-producing keys (letters, digits, punctuation)
